## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- UI Framework: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- State Management: TanStack Query
- Routing: wouter
- Authentication: Cloudflare One
- Knowledge Processing:
  - Document Parsing: PDF.js, Mammoth, XLSX
  - Web Content: Axios, Cheerio
  - Text Processing: Custom chunking algorithms
- Speech Capabilities: Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- PostgreSQL 15 or higher
- Cloudflare One account for authentication
- API keys for the LLM providers you want to use (OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepSeek/Gemini)
- For speech features: Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech API credentials (optional)
- Sufficient storage space for uploaded knowledge files

## Authentication

This application uses Cloudflare One for authentication. When deployed, it expects the following headers from Cloudflare:

- `CF-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`: The email address of the authenticated user
- `CF-Access-JWT-Assertion`: The JWT token from Cloudflare

To set up authentication:

1. Create a Cloudflare Zero Trust account
2. Configure an application in the Zero Trust dashboard
3. Set up authentication policies
4. Configure your deployment to use Cloudflare Access

The application will automatically use the Cloudflare headers to authenticate users and manage their conversations.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/chat_app

# LLM Provider API Keys - Include only the ones you want to use
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional - Microsoft Cognitive Services for Speech Features
SPEECH_KEY=your_azure_speech_key
SPEECH_REGION=your_azure_speech_region
```

Notes:
- The application will only display and enable LLM providers for which valid API keys are provided. Missing API keys will cause the corresponding provider to be hidden from the UI automatically.
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech features require valid Microsoft Cognitive Services credentials, but these features are optional and the application will work without them.

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Docker Deployment

To run the application using Docker:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables
3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Provider Configuration

The application supports configurable AI providers through JSON configuration files located in `server/config/providers/`.

### Adding a New Provider

1. Create a new configuration file in `server/config/providers/` (e.g., `mistral.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "mistral",
     "name": "Mistral AI",
     "icon": "SiMistral",
     "models": [
       {
         "id": "mistral-medium",
         "name": "Mistral Medium",
         "contextLength": 32000,
         "defaultModel": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Implement the provider interface in `client/src/lib/llm/providers/`:
   ```typescript
   import type { LLMProvider } from "../types";

   export class MistralProvider implements LLMProvider {
     // Implementation details
   }
   ```

3. Add the provider to the initialization logic in `client/src/lib/llm/providers/index.ts`.

4. Add the corresponding environment variable for the API key.

Note: If the API key for a provider is not available in the environment variables, the provider will be automatically hidden from the UI. This allows for flexible deployment configurations where only some providers are enabled.

## Usage

### Basic Chat Usage
1. Start a new conversation by clicking the "New Chat" button
2. Select your preferred AI model from the dropdown
3. Type your message and press Enter or click the send button
4. View your conversation history in the sidebar
5. Toggle between light and dark modes using the theme toggle button

### Knowledge Management
1. Access the Knowledge Management by clicking the "Knowledge" button in the sidebar
2. Add knowledge sources in three ways:
   - **File Upload**: Upload supported document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX, PPTX, MD)
   - **URL**: Enter a URL to automatically extract and process web content
   - **Text**: Directly paste or type text content
3. For each knowledge source, you can:
   - Provide a name and optional description
   - Enable/disable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for large documents
4. Manage your knowledge sources:
   - View all saved knowledge sources
   - Delete knowledge sources you no longer need
   - Attach knowledge sources to specific conversations
5. Use knowledge in conversations:
   - Attached knowledge sources will be used to enhance AI responses
   - The AI will automatically reference relevant knowledge when answering questions
